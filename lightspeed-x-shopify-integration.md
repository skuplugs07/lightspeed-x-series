# Integration of Lightspeed X and Shopify by SKUPlugs

In today’s fast-paced retail environment, efficiency, real-time data synchronization, and streamlined operations are vital for business growth. Many businesses operate both a physical store and an online store, which means syncing Point of Sale (POS) systems with eCommerce platforms is not just a luxury - it’s a necessity. One of the most powerful combinations in retail technology today is the [**integration of Lightspeed X and Shopify**](https://skuplugs.com/lightspeed-x-series-shopify-integration/) by SKUPlugs.

## Why Choose Lightspeed X and Shopify?

Lightspeed X, formerly known as Lightspeed Retail, is a cloud-based POS solution known for its powerful features tailored for retail, restaurant, and golf businesses.
